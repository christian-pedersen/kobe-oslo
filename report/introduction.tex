Langmuir probes, as well as other instruments, are often situated outside of space crafts.
The precence of the spacecraft causes disturbances to the local conditions we want to measure,
these disturbances need to be corrected for.
Many studies has been done on the flow of plasma around spacecraft and of the wake the
spacecraft creates \citep{miloch_wake_2010,engwall_wake_2006}.
