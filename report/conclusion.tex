In the LEO regime, where the simulations have been done, the photoemitted currents are weak compared with
background plasma. Due to this the effect seen on the Langmuir probes were small, further studies should be done
in other plasma regimes where the photoemmision is more pronounced, i.e. MEO, GEO or in the magnetospheric tail lobes.
