We compared P-E and without P-E. We think whether photo emission affect the Probes.
We set the size of the Probes to 1 $cm^3$ in this simulation. But it is the same size as the grid.
So density does not become 0 in the inner of Probes. We need to simulate a variety of sizes.
We try the case of more number of grid, longer a grid, and size of Probes.
In order to measure the characteristic value of each particle, we set probes in the
place that the wake is formed or not. But they are not a real physical model.
(For example, if we give probes the photoelectric effect or if we change the size
of satellite and probes to realistic scales, the results might be changed.)
We see a difference in cases, so it might be a case we have not considered that that is significant.
