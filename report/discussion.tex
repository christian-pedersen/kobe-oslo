In order to measure the characteristic value of each particle, we set probes in the
place that the wake is formed or not. 
We set the size of the Probes to 1 $cm^3$ in this simulation. But it is the same size as the grid.
It is so samll that density does not become 0 in the interior of Probes. And they are not a real 
physical model. We need to simulate a variety of sizes.
(For example, if we give probes the photoelectric effect or if we change the size of satellite and 
probes to realistic scales, if we the results might be changed.)
We see a difference in cases, so it might be a case we have not considered that that is significant.
