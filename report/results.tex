\subsection{Induced electric current}

	%Redo this part if necessary
	The plasma is flowing in in relation to the coordinate system in the simulations.
	Due to this an induced electrical field, \(\varepsilon\), will appear. To analyze the potential we
	want to correct for this potential field. The induced electrical field will
	neutralize the Lorentz force. Combined with the electrostatic approximation
	we can obtain the \(\varepsilon\)

	\begin{equation}
		\vec{\varepsilon} = \vec{v_D}\times \vec{B}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation}
		\int{Edx} = -\phi
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation}
		\phi = -\int \vec{v}_d\times\vec{B} \approx -\int \left( 41600 \text{m/s}\cdot 50E-6 \text{T} \right) dx
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		\phi = 2.08 \text{x}
	\end{equation}
